This Python script demonstrates the creation of a random integer array using TensorFlow, which is then sorted using the Selection Sort algorithm. The user is prompted to input the desired size of the array, ensuring a customizable experience. After sorting, the script visualizes the sorted array with Matplotlib, providing a clear graphical representation of the sorted elements. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the implementation and visualization of sorting algorithms in Python.
