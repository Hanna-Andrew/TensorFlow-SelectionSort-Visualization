This Python script 📜 demonstrates the creation of a random integer array using TensorFlow 🔢, which is then sorted using the Selection Sort algorithm 📈. The user is prompted to input the desired size of the array, ensuring a customizable experience 🎛️. After sorting, the script visualizes the sorted array with Matplotlib 🖼️, providing a clear graphical representation of the sorted elements. This project serves as an educational tool 📚 for understanding the implementation and visualization of sorting algorithms in Python 🐍.
